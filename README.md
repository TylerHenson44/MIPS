# MIPS
MIPS Processor in VHDL &amp; Assembler 

## Components

### Assembler
Python scripts to turn MIPS Assembly into machine code. Will update with supported commands as added.

### Processor
VHDL representation of a MIPS processor. I plan to have subdirectories with component libraries I have created and then the final put together processor.
Will begin with a single clock cycle per instruction and move on to pipelined. May change repo structure later.
